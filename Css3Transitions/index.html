                                The Sillustani Chullpas are located on top of a gentle hill overlooking the Umayo Lagoon. Apparently here nobles, rulers or priests were buried who were then revered, that's why their preferential place.<br/>  
                                The cemetery of Sillustani, famous for its ninety chullpas built as circular stone towers, where the authorities of the town of Collao were buried. This archaeological site, located on the shores of Lake Umayo, is formed by almost 90 chullpas or ayawasis (houses of the dead) built with large blocks carved from volcanic stone extracted from two nearby quarries. </p>
